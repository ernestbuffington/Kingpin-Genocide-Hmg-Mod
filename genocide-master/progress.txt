Right then Wozza here is the text file that will hopefully explain to
you everything that you need to knwo to add the option to have this as
either the HMG or Bazooka. So sit back relax and get to it.

Converting the weapons
======================
file: g_spawn.c
routine: ED_callspawn

This is where you will need to add the selection switch to spawn either
the HMG or Bazooka.

Selecting a bonus
=================
file: p_client.c
routine: clientobituary

This is where you will need to check for the random bonus and add/delete/
modify the appropriatre ones for whichever mod your playing.

Message's
=========
file: arena_utils.c
routine: various

This is where the bonus message's are kept.

New server commands
===================
files: g_local.h, g_main.c, g_save.c
routines: Initgame(g_save.c), the others can be found by searching for
maxstreak for the example.

By copying the maxstreak command and renaming it gamemode should be enough
for selecting which game you want to run.

An example of a timer for when you add the invincibilty can be found by
searching for bonus_timer. There's still the code in there for the
invincibility so merging the two should provide what you need. You should
be able to set it up so if you added 30 or 2 to the timer it will give you
the type of shield needed.
